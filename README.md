# Drowsiness-Detection

Driver Drowsiness Detection is a project aimed at detecting whether a driver's eyes are closed or open, and if they remain closed for a certain period of time, it triggers an alarm to awaken the driver. 
This project primarily utilizes computer vision techniques to analyze the driver's face and eye movements in real-time.
